# final-project-NLP-fake-news

Paula Iglesias Barge, Data Analytics Part Time @ Ironhack - June 2020

This is my final project from the Data Analytics Part Time course at Ironhack. 

I will be working on my first NLP project and tuning a kaggle dataset to understand how fake news are detected and if I can correctly train it to detect better and more unnacurate articles from wide known media.
